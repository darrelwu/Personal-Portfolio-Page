# Darrel Wu Portfolio
 
## Personal Portfolio Webpage
 
My motivation today is to alter the codebase so that it follows accessibility standards so that the website is optimized for search engines. In order to accomplish this goal the following problems must have been solved:
 
 
* The portfolio page must highlight projects 
* The portfolio page must include developers name, photo/avatar 
* The portfolio page must link to navigation bar with “about developer”, “projects”, and “contact information”
* The portfolio base code must have comments in HTML and CSS with the structure to flow logically
* The portfolio page must ensure functionality
* The portfolio page first picture must be larger than the others
* The portfolio images are deployed to the applications
* The portfolio adapts to different viewports

## Usage
This is to demonstrate my own personal portfolio website that will be used to show recruiters and others on the different projects I have participated in.
